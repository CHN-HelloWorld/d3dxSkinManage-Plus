# Plugin development guide

This guide is for developers who know Python and want to build extension tools for d3dxSkinManage-Plus. The application organizes Mods, categories, combination presets, and appearance variants by game. Plugins can combine these public capabilities into dedicated tools for organizing, checking, and operating on a library.

Plugins access the host through `src.plugin_sdk`, can use multiple Python modules and packages, declare plugin dependencies, activate on demand, and submit background tasks. Third-party Python dependencies are not installed automatically. Users install extensions from archives or plugin folders.

Start with the skeleton in section 1 and confirm that its command works. Then read the three bundled examples in this order. Each includes a manifest, source code, an English language pack, and usage instructions, and can be enabled directly. You do not need to enable them all at once.

| Order | Practical example | Purpose | Main topics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Mod inventory export](../../../plugins/example.mod-inventory/README.md) | Export a CSV inventory for the current game or a category subtree | Multiple modules, commands activated on demand, configuration, background computation, and atomic file saving |
| 2 | [Preset audit](../../../plugins/example.preset-audit/README.md) | Find invalid Mod and variant references in combinations | Unresolved references, startup activation, pages, events, batched queries, and cleanup |
| 3 | [Preset cycling](../../../plugins/example.preset-cycle/README.md) | Switch to the previous or next combination using shortcuts or buttons | Write permissions, asynchronous operations, repeated requests, completion feedback, and cancellation |

Section 10 provides reading and practice steps for each example. Sections 2–9 cover the interfaces, section 11 covers custom interfaces, and section 12 covers development checks and troubleshooting.
